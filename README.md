# Chess Variation Explorer & Criticality Analyzer

This Python program uses Stockfish 17 (with NNUE enabled) together with the Lichess Masters openings database to help you explore chess openings. It:
- Plays an opening line (e.g., the Catalan) based on a predefined dictionary.
- Queries the Lichess Masters API for candidate moves beyond the opening line.
- Uses Stockfish 17 to follow engine variations a few moves deep.
- Analyzes each move to determine whether it is "critical" (i.e., if an alternative move would drop the evaluation by a specified threshold).
- Generates SVG images of key positions.
- Provides textual explanations of the main ideas/plans for both sides.
- Displays a simple command-line spinner (loading animation) during analysis.

## Features

- **Opening Explorer:** Uses a built-in dictionary of openings (e.g., "Catalan") to start analysis.
- **Variation Analysis:** Explores candidate moves and extends variations up to a defined depth.
- **Criticality Analysis:** Flags moves as "critical" if not playing them would result in a significant evaluation drop.
- **Visualization:** Creates SVG images of key board positions.
- **Explanations:** Provides simple commentary on plans and ideas in the final position.
- **User Feedback:** Displays a spinner during engine analysis for a better command-line experience.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess)
- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- **Stockfish 17 with NNUE enabled**

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-variation-explorer.git
   cd chess-variation-explorer
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies:**

   Use `pip` to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install python-chess requests
   ```

3. **Download Stockfish 17 with NNUE:**

   - Download the latest Stockfish 17 binary with NNUE support from the [official Stockfish website](https://stockfishchess.org/) or its [GitHub releases](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases).
   - Place the executable in your project directory (or another known location).

4. **Configure Stockfish:**

   In the source code, update the `engine_path` variable to point to your Stockfish 17 executable. For example:

   ```python
   engine_path = "./stockfish_17"
   ```

   If your executable is in a different folder, adjust the path accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**

   In your terminal, execute:

   ```bash
   python your_program_file.py
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts:**

   - When prompted, enter an opening name (e.g., `Catalan`).
   - The program will process the opening line, query the Lichess Masters API for candidate moves, and analyze variations.
   - SVG images will be generated for key positions (saved in the project directory).
   - The analysis—including move sequences, criticality information, and explanations—will be displayed in the terminal.

3. **View Generated Images:**

   Open the generated SVG files (e.g., `opening_line_position.svg`, `variation_<move>_step_<n>.svg`) in a web browser or an SVG viewer to see the positions.

## Project Structure

- **`your_program_file.py`**  
  The main Python script that integrates:
  - Opening line playback (using a predefined dictionary).
  - Lichess Masters API queries.
  - Variation exploration and criticality analysis.
  - SVG image generation and explanation output.
  
- **`README.md`**  
  This file containing installation and usage instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Stockfish Issues:**
  - Ensure that `engine_path` is correctly set.
  - Verify that the Stockfish binary is executable (you may need to adjust file permissions).

- **Dependency Errors:**
  - Confirm that all required Python packages are installed (`python-chess` and `requests`).
  
- **API Connectivity:**
  - Make sure your internet connection is active when querying the Lichess Masters API.
